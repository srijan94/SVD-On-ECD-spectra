# SVD-On-ECD-spectra
It is useful when we want to do SVD analysis on electronic circular dichorism spectra of some protein or peptdes.
Here in ABGY_30TFE_MRE.csv we have an electronic circular dichorism spectra of custom made peptide ABGY dissolved in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) in 30% water.Circular dichorism spectroscopy is done from wavelength 190 to 250 nm with a space
of 1 nm with temperature variation 5 degree celcius to 55 degree celcius.Mean residue elipsity also calculated.Truncated SVD is perforformed to know the helical components and random coil component from ECD spectra of that peptide.
